        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <h3>Play horses, then mount heroes on them to build your army. Attack empty spaces on your opponent's side of the board to score points based on your card's attack power. Get the score meter up to 5 to win.</h3>
        <p>Each card has an attack power (left number) and health (right number).</p>
        <p>There are three phases of the game: draw, play, and fight.</p>
        <p>During the draw phase, you can draw either a Horse or a Hero.</p>
        <p>During the play phase, you can play Horses to empty slots on your side of the board, or you can play Heroes onto horses.</p>
        <p>During the fight phase, the computer will play its cards and then combat begins. Combat resolves like so:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cards attacking empty spaces will deal their attack damage directly to the game score counter.</li>
            <li>Cards attacking opposing cards will deal their attack damage to that card's health.</li>
            <li>Cards with less than 1 health will be removed from the play area.</li>
            <li>After resolving all card attacks, if the game score counter has reached -5, you lose. If it has reached 5, you win.</li>
        </ol>
